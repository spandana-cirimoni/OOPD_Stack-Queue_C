# Abstract Data Types - Stack, Queue and Fixed Array

Make use of the Array class to implement three more ADTs:

• Stack — an ADT that contains a list of elements such that the list has last-in, first-out (LIFO)
semantics, i.e., elements are inserted into the front of the list and removed from the front of
the list

• Queue — an ADT that contains a list of elements such that the list has first-in, first-out (FIFO)
semantics, i.e., elements are inserted into the of the list and removed from the front of the list;

• Fixed Array — an ADT that is an array, but cannot grow or shrink.
